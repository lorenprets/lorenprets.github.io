Due before class meets Friday, September 25
Find two examples of design – one good and one bad. The examples should be in tech but can be software or something physical in society. For each example, take a screenshot of the part of the design that you are evaluating (if you are writing about something that is not software, find an image of the product/design) and write a short paragraph (4-6 sentences) explaining what about that design is either good or bad. Publish your write-up as a post on your website with the title “Good vs. Bad Design”. The screenshot/image that you use should appear in the post with the description of each image appearing below the image.

This photo of a simple parking sign is an example of a good design. The sign clearly states the days and hours that people can park. In addition, it doesn't have any additional information. Therefore, it would be easy for anyone to park there.   

![Bad](https://anm.digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pawhohasparkingduty-768x1024.jpg)

This photo of a very complex parking sign is an example of a bad design. There are 6 signs which would be very confusing for anyone who would try to park there. In addition, there are "exceptions" on some of the parking which would most likely be increddibly confusing. This would be a better design if they simplified the information and had less signs.
