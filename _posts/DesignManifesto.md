When designing an app, there are 5 critical steps that every creator must take to ensure that their design process is the most effective. 

1. Find the most effective kind of prototype 	

When designing an app, it is crucial to select the most beneficial prototype models. Every good designer should begin with a low fidelity prototype such as a paper prototype in order to get ideas down on paper and determine what looks the best. After completing the low fidelity prototype, designers must choose between a medium or high fidelity prototype. Though the high fidelity prototype will be more functional than the medium, one is not necessarily better than the other because it depends on the designer’s preference and vision for their app. For example, if a designer decides that they will only need simple buttons to get the full effect of the app’s design, a medium fidelity prototype would most likely be more fitting. When determining the type of prototype it is important to consider the efficiency and effectiveness. 

2. Consider the functions of the app  

  When designing apps, each designer should have an initial vision. However, it is important to create functions within the app that will be logical for users. For example, designers should consider using common functions that appear in other, widely used apps. For example, instead of creating an entirely new alarm clock for Clean HM, we used the iOS alarm as a template. In addition, designers should reflect on positive and negative experiences that they have had on other apps and use that to influence their designs.  

3. Ensure that the app is fair and ethical 

  Every designer must follow a code of ethics when designing their app. Although the specifics will change based on each designer and their app, there should be similarities. For example, designers must respect the privacy of their users, create high quality work, ensure that their app benefits the public, and so on. 

4. Do proper tests to ensure that your ideas make sense to others 

  When designing an app, the designer must do trial runs and receive feedback from potential users and other outside sources to ensure that their designs are logical and ethical. For example, designers should set up usability tests to test that the app is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Thus, the user must be able to understand the content of the app and how to use the app. Designers should begin these tests on their low fidelity prototypes to troubleshoot before creating a higher fidelity prototype that is much more time consuming and refined. 

5. Adjust ideas to make them reasonable and doable 

  Designers may come up with designs that are not reasonable to create or use. Therefore, it is important that they are flexible and will be able to adjust and redesign based on the circumstances. For example, designers will sometimes have to make the functions of their app less complex on their low and medium fidelity prototypes.
