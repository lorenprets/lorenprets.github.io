title: Fly on the Wall

  In light of the Coronavirus, there have been a number of changes that have impacted both students and teachers. During online school, a number of problems presented themselves. First of all, there were numerous scheduling related issues. For example, each full class class only met twice a week and half credit classes only met once a week. Due to this decrease, students ended up learning less than they would if they were in person. In order to solve this issue, many teachers tried to move though topics faster which often led to students to not understand it as well.  Furthermore, there were often technical difficulties which also contributed to less class time. Since Zoom only allows teachers to see students’ faces, it tended to be difficult to read students' body language, helping them ensure that students understand what is happening. Additionally, teachers could not monitor if students were on their phone or doing something they were supposed to during class.
  During in person school, there were also problems.  First of all, despite attempts to enforce socially distancing, there are often times when people are clumped together. For example, during break, people normally crowd around a tent to pick up their snack. In addition, in an attempt to prevent this same thing from happening during lunch periods, they spread the food out all over campus which makes it very hard to pick up or find the food that I want. On the other hand, many people don't always follow the arrows directing foot traffic.  On days with bad weather, many people crowd under tents which is problematic. Therefore, teachers need to spend their off periods monitoring students’ social distancing and ensuring that everyone is being safe. In good weather, students are allowed to sit on the field during their off periods which often overlaps with outdoor gym classes. Furthermore, since there is so much space for students to eat and few garbage cans, there ends up being a lot of trash left outside. In addition, everyone needs to wear a mask at all times during classes which prevents teachers from reading students’ facial expressions.
